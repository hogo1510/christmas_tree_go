# christmas_tree_go
Basic Christmas tree in the go language

## How To use
```
git clone https://github.com/hogo1510/christmas_tree_go/main
go run Main.go
```
## Be Aware !
- somethings (like vars) are written in dutch (hoogte = height)
- if you want to change the height you should look for the integer named hoogte!

## code challange !
- make it so it has an user input (easy)
- give it some color (Medium)
- Add some xmas music (hard)
